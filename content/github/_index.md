## About GitHub auth
To be able to do anything in Halfpipe your user **must** be part of a team in GitHub. These teams are consistent with current CloudFoundry orgs, as they are also used to push your code in the correct org. Important to get this right! Furthermore, your user in Github **must** have a verified primary email otherwise you will not be able to login to Concourse!

[Check if you are part of a specific team](https://github.com/orgs/springernature/teams)

If you are not yet in a team you wish to be part of, ask a friendly person in that team or someone on Slack in `#github-admins` to help you!


## Repo settings
Another requirement is that the GitHub team `Springer Nature Read` needs **read** access on your repo otherwise Concourse will not be able to clone your repository!
