## Ask for help
We try to be available as much as possible on slack in `#halfpipe-users`. Slack is great for quick things, but more involved discussions can get hard to follow, so we also have a Halfpipe category in [ee-discourse](https://ee-discourse.springernature.io/c/halfpipe). Also we can always arrange a chat in person in London or Berlin, or by video call to Pune.

## Submit a bug
We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/springernature/halfpipe/issues) to track bugs and feature requests. PRs welcome too :)

## View our backlog
You can see what we're up to on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/springernature/projects/9).

## Suggest an enhancement
If you have a suggestion for a new feature or want to discuss a topic in detail, we have a Halfpipe category in [ee-discourse](https://ee-discourse.springernature.io/c/halfpipe). Or just create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/springernature/halfpipe/issues) if it's pretty straight forward.

## Monthly updates
We publish monthly(ish) updates on our progress to [Hive](https://hive.springernature.com/community/information-technology/engineering-enablement-ee/blog/tags#/?tags=halfpipe).

## Stakeholder group
If you would like to work with us to help shape the direction CI/CD at Springer Nature, we have an Engineering Enablement stakeholder group that collaborates on our roadmap and backlog prioritisation. Ask a member of the halfpipe team to find out more.

## Service status
We communicate updates to any disruptions on slack in `#halfpipe-users` and `#follow-ee`.
